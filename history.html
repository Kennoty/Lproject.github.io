            <p>B.C</p>
            <p>The first roads in Britain were build by Roman legions,they
served for military purposes and were very simple
constructions.Some of these ways saved until nowadays,more
specificlly the oldest road of England "Ridgeway" partly
was builded in that time.</p>
            <br><p>Medieval</p></br>
            <p>In my opinion medieval didn't significantly influence
Britain's roads.Of course number of roads in the world increased
and in England,too.
  During this time and B.C era all the soldiers from all the countries
move on left side of the road,because it was comfortable to draw out the weapon and meet
an enemy that walking along another side,citizens haved to go the same side of the road.</p>
            <br><p>16th,17th,18th centuries</p></br>
            <p>During and after medieval,on a roads of all the world started emerging more and more carts and wagons.
Their coachmen were comfortable a right-side traffic,but in England and in left-side traffic remains
  In the 18th century first traffic rules in England(that forbit moving on the right road's side).First
railway("Stockton & Darlington Railway") was opened in 1825 year and tram "Volk's electric railway" was
opened in 1883.</p>
            <br><p>19th century</p></br>
            <p>Tram and rail ways continue improving.New roads were builded</p>
            <br><p>20th century</p></br>
            <p>first half of 20th century was very heavy for all the world  and ofcourse Great Britain.All the big countries spended
big budgets on their military forces.British roads developed very slow and sometimes were under bombardement(World war 2
battle for Britain).During the world war two in the territory of Great Britain were build a few defence lines.
  During the second half of this century industry of Britain climbed higher and higher in 1958
the first motorway(highway) "Preston by-pass" was opened in England.The next years in England were builded 319 more motorways.</p>
